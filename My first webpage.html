<p><b>Sharks</b>, together with rays and skates, make up the subclass <em>Elasmobranchii of the Chondrichthyes.</em>
<strong>Sharks</strong> differ from other elasmobranchs, however, and <i>resemble ordinary fishes</i>, in the fusiform shape of their body and in the
 location of their gill clefts on each side of the head. <mark>Though there are exceptions, sharks typically have a tough skin that is 
 dull gray in colour and is roughened by toothlike scales. </mark>

 <img src = "Images/blacktip.jpg" alt = "blacktip image" width = "200" height = "200">
<p>They also usually have a muscular, asymmetrical, upturned tail; pointed fins; and a pointed snout extending forward and over 
a crescentic mouth set with sharp triangular teeth. <small>Sharks</small> have no swim bladder and must swim perpetually to keep from sinking to the bottom.
